**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Did you rule out network issues? Do you encounter the same issue when using another FTP server?

**Example code**
A short and standalone code example that demonstrates the issue. Don't copy-paste a few lines from your project, it makes it difficult to rule out issues in other parts of your code.

**Console output**
Use `client.ftp.verbose = true` to log every communication detail. Copy-paste the output of your console here. Make sure to redact IPs, URLs or passwords.

**Which version of Node.js are you using?**
e.g. Node 1.11.0

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here. What FTP server are you using? What environment are you running in?
